This is a simple idle game with a tongue in cheek narrative told through tutorial dialogue, careful use of font and text colors, descriptions, and easter eggs.
The primary goal is simple. Get more money, shovel more snow.

The user begins by manually clicking a button to shovel snow until earning 15$. (This is calculated at $0.16 / Kg snow)
Once 15$ has been earned a shop appears in which the user is able to "hire" children to dig for them and increase the Kg/second of snow accumulated.

As they progress more items become available.
Each time an item is purchased its cost will increase. 

This is the basic loop, continue reaching higher wallet values.
